# Tilt module SW-520D
## Introduction

 SW-520D will output two different states of "1" or "0" with different tilt angles. In this example, the GPIO drive control of the system is adopted to read the state value through GPIO 

test script : sw520d_gpio44.sh

### test process

1. increase the execution authority : chmod +x sw520d_gpio44.sh
2. Execute the script program : ./sw520d_ gpio44.sh 
3.  Turn the tilt module and observe the reading
